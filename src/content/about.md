title: About danieldunderfelt.com
---
Danieldunderfelt.com is the personal website and blog of Daniel Dunderfelt.

### The technology

The site is built with open-source technologies (GatsbyJS)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/] and [React](https://reactjs.org/). I use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage content and I am hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). These technologies and services are what enables this website to work reliably and fast like lightning!

For analytics I use the open-source app [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) installed on our own server. Fathom allows us to gather valuable insight into how the website is performing while not encroaching on our readers' privacy. Read more in the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).
