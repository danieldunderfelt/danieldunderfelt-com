The first month of freelancing isnâ€™t really over yet, but Iâ€™m long overdue for a blog post anyway. I never promised that these would be regular!

I have enjoyed getting my hands dirty (thanks, Unsplash) with my first new project and all the new things included in it. Iâ€™m getting the hang of Typescript, and itâ€™s a special kind of joy seeing the editor come alive with the type information. Wide-reaching, sweeping refactors are also a pleasure to perform. I am a JetBrains junkie and I can report that WebStorm has excellent Typescript support baked in! That said, Iâ€™m not so sure that Iâ€™d use Typescript for a side-project. I can see the value in it, but it also comes with a fair bit of hassle.

Yes, I know about VSCode. Yes, Iâ€™m sticking with WebStorm. Another thing Iâ€™ve discovered in WebStorm are the run configurations. Previously Iâ€™ve been running all scripts from a separate terminal, but having the build running inside the editor is quite handy. I can attach a debugger to Chrome and get, what I think is, some kind of superpower.

I have also become much more confident with GraphQL. I have always known that I learn by DOING real projects, but my experience with GraphQL underscored this intensely. Iâ€™ve been reading about it, and also attended a workshop, but when I actually tried it it clicked. Rest assured Iâ€™ll be using GraphQL everywhere now. No going back to REST.

Speaking of no going backâ€¦ I received my first bit of income for the work I did at the tail end of March. From the Holvi notification to seeing the raw fruits of my work, it was very satisfying. I will probably not seek out full-time employment for a long time ðŸ˜³

Holvi has proven to be a very worthwhile investment during this month. Iâ€™ve made some purchases with the account, and attaching receipts and invoices on the go is a breeze. Iâ€™ve sent a few electronic invoices, and I look forward to the notification from Holvi when they get fulfilled! All the headache of running a business I thought Iâ€™d have to endure seems to have evaporated.

I also retained an accountant, whose work will be very smooth since I can just export all the relevant information from Holvi with all attached receipts. Itâ€™s also a huge relief knowing that everything is safe in Holvi and I donâ€™t need to juggle various small pieces of paper.

I might upgrade my simple business proprietorship to a full, incorporated limited liability company in the fall. It will give me more flexibility with taxes, wages and accounting. But thatâ€™s a chapter for another dayâ€¦

I will continue the current project for at least another month, after which I look forward to the next enjoyable puddle of mud to stick my hands into!

Until next time.
